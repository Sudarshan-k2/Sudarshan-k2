### 👋 Hey, I’m Sudarshan

I’m a Web3 & AI developer in the making — focused on building real, production-grade blockchain systems.  
Not doing tutorials. Not copying code. My work is centered on:

- **Smart Contracts (Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat)**
- **DeFi Systems, Vaults & Strategy Engines**
- **Security-first engineering (testing, fuzzing, gas optimization)**
- **Full-stack Web3 (Next.js, React, Wagmi, Node.js)**
- **AI integrations (LangChain, agent workflows, on-chain automation)**

Right now I’m going through a structured 5-month engineering roadmap where I build:

- Audit-style smart contract micro-projects  
- A full Yield Aggregator (startup-level architecture)  
- An AI-powered Web3 Portfolio Copilot (LLM + on-chain data)  

Everything here is built from scratch — with clean architecture, tests, and documentation.

If you want to track my progress, every repo has:
- Clear commits  
- Tests  
- Scripts  
- Architecture notes  
- Roadmaps  

### 💬 Current Focus (Dec 2025 → Apr 2026)
- Advanced Solidity & Security  
- Foundry Testing + Fuzzing  
- Multi-strategy Vaults  
- LangChain Agents for Web3  
- Full-stack Web3 development
